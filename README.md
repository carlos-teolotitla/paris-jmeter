Integrating PARIS Maven project with JMeter
============

- The plugin com.lazerycode.jmeter should not depend on a local JMeter installation.
- It must be possible to start the JMeter test from command line (without gui).
- The JMeter GUI should also be accessibla directly via the plugin (e.g. via a separate Maven goal).
- It should be possible to include the JMeter Plugins.
- The plugin should generate meaningful reports (or there must be some other possibility to generate these reports).
